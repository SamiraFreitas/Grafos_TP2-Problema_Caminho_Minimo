## 📝 Sobre 
This repository refers to the development project for the Grafos subject. Project being developed by a duo, it will contain shared knowledge that will be applied to develop algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (PCV). To develop the work, the library framework was used, it can be found at:  [💻 Biblioteca](https://github.com/SamiraFreitas/Biblioteca-Grafos) The algorithms were separated into two categories:

-Constructive Algorithms

The purpose of which is to create an initial route to the traveling salesman problem.

-Refinement Algorithm

The objective of which is to improve the route generated by the previous algorithm by examining alternative path changes

Among the constructive algorithms, we can highlight that the following were used:

Nearest Neighbor - Each iteration walks to the nearest vertex that has not yet been visited until all vertices are part of the route.

For refinement, the following method was used:

2-opt - Removes two distinct edges from the route and reinserts them in the best possible way.
